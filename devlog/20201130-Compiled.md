Compiled
========

Finally, everything built together.

Pixiu
-----

* SSL works
* session bug fixed
* remove HTTP pipeline (too easy to make bugs, will bring back soon)

Project infra
-------------

* Toolchain
  * CMake
  * GNU C++17 standard
  * ReactJS
  * Docker
* Package manager
  * backend: CMake Hunter
  * frontend: yarn

Summary
-------

HTTP pipeline behavior is so variant between browsers, just give it up for a while.

Currently C++ code compiling time is very long, probably needs some incremental compile solution.

Don't want to use redux and saga, try to develop a new solution to maintain the front-end model.
